<h1>Kyle Nelson Developer Notes</h1>

<h2>DevNote 9/16</h2>
<p></p>
Last Wednesday, Defler and I met and created the majority of the project plan together. We submitted it to our customer for tentative approval. My portion totaled 105 words exactly.
<p></p>
Today I wrote the Title Page, Table of Contents, Nonfunctional Requirements, Feasibility, and Conclusion sections of the Requirements Specification document. This totaled 658 words exactly. The Metrics document I wrote counted for an additional 138 words exactly. This brings the running tally for the word count, including the project plan, to 901 words exactly.

We are assuming that the ARCore image identification software will be insufficient on its own, and will require use of the MLKit in order to provide timely and accurate answers. Marrying these two tools in order to identify the cards being scanned will likely comprise the hardest portion of the project. As such we have allocated plenty of time for these sections in case of unexpected difficulty.
