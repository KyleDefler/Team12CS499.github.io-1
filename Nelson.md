<h1>Kyle Nelson Developer Notes</h1>

<h2>DevNote 9/16</h2>
<p></p>
Last Wednesday, Defler and I met and created the majority of the project plan together. We submitted it to our customer for tentative approval. My portion totaled 105 words exactly.
<p></p>
Today I wrote the Title Page, Table of Contents, Nonfunctional Requirements, Feasibility, and Conclusion sections of the Requirements Specification document. This totaled 658 words exactly. The Metrics document I wrote counted for an additional 138 words exactly. This brings the running tally for the word count, including the project plan, to 901 words exactly.
<p></p>
We are assuming that the ARCore image identification software will be insufficient on its own, and will require use of the MLKit in order to provide timely and accurate answers. Marrying these two tools in order to identify the cards being scanned will likely comprise the hardest portion of the project. As such we have allocated plenty of time for these sections in case of unexpected difficulty.

<h2>DevNote 9/30</h2>
<p></p>
My primary contributions over the previous weeks have been visual elements. I constructed the domain model diagram, after consulting online resources regarding proper implimentation. The description for the domain model diagram is 136 words. I also constructed a mockup of the user interface for the program. I have also been reviewing the metrics we initially stipulated, and found that while the approximate manhour breakdown is still feasible, the user story format for the product size estimate is no longer viable. In stead we have switched to a method approximation approach. These revised metrics account for 104 words.
<p></p>
I also wrote the testing portion of the presentation. Defler and I collaborated on the exact testing requirements, with him writing the long winded version for the document, and I the short version for the slides. This accounts for 124 words.
