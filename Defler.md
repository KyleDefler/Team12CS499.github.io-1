<h1>Kyle Defler Developer Notes</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>DevNote 9/16</h2>
<p></p>
Kyle Nelson and I met on Wednesday (September 12th) to work on the Project Plan assignment. We got a sizable portion of that aissgnment finished (104 words) , and we went in our rough draft to our customer, whom approved of our work. 
<p></p>
On this day I contributed my part to the Project Plan assignemt, which included parts of the Planning and Estimating and the Requirments. Specifically in the requirments, I wrote the introduction, project overview, and the development and target environments (865 words). 
<p></p>
Additionally, I have created this team website. This website is built off of the GitHub Pages platform, which allows me to host html pages via our GitHub respository. This allows our team to quickly and easily impliment changes to our site, using the same tool we use to work on our actual project. (216 words)

<h2>DevNote 9/30</h2>
<p></p>
Kyle Nelson, Austin Williams and I met on Friday (September 28th) to work on the Architecture assignment. I completed the Testing portion of the assignment (637 words), and began work on editing the website. 
<p></p>
During our digitial group meeting on the afternoon of September 30th, I made edits to the Testing portion of the Architecture Assignment, took an example photo of playing cards on a table for the use of the User Interface draft, and made the edits to the project website. Edits I made to the website include adding the pages for the Scedule, the Requirments (which used parts of the Project Plan assignment, and adding the contact information to the home page (122 words). Additionally, I contributed to making our Powerpoint for our presentation, making the Project Overview, Tools Used, and Architecture slides (81 words.) During this meeting we also discussed how we will go about creating our Hand Finding algorithm.

<h2>DevNote 10/12</h2>
<p></p>
Kyle Nelson, Austin Williams and I met a few times, both in person and in a digital conference call, to work on the content, practice, and present our presentation of our project so far.  
<p></p>
Additionally, Kyle Nelson and I meet on Wednesday (October 12th) to work on the code of the actual project. I provided the cards for Kyle to use for him gathering the image dataset of cards. I began creating a "hello world" sort of program so that we have a solid foundation to work on. While working on getting the AR Core implimented, a software bugged when trying to push the.apk file to my Android phone for testing caused several crashes in Windows. This part of the project is being picked up by Austin, and I will be working on implimenting the ML Kit for image labeling from this point on.
