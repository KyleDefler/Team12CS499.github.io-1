<h1>Kyle Defler Developer Notes</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>DevNote 9/16</h2>
<p></p>
Kyle Nelson and I met on Wednesday (September 12th) to work on the Project Plan assignment. We got a sizable portion of that aissgnment finished (104 words) , and we went in our rough draft to our customer, whom approved of our work. 
<p></p>
On this day I contributed my part to the Project Plan assignemt, which included parts of the Planning and Estimating and the Requirments. Specifically in the requirments, I wrote the introduction, project overview, and the development and target environments (865 words). 
<p></p>
Additionally, I have created this team website. This website is built off of the GitHub Pages platform, which allows me to host html pages via our GitHub respository. This allows our team to quickly and easily impliment changes to our site, using the same tool we use to work on our actual project. (216 words)
