<h1>Kyle Defler Developer Notes</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>DevNote 9/16</h2>
<p></p>
Kyle Nelson and I met on Wednesday (September 12th) to work on the Project Plan assignment. We got a sizable portion of that aissgnment finished (104 words) , and we went in our rough draft to our customer, whom approved of our work. 
<p></p>
On this day I contributed my part to the Project Plan assignemt, which included parts of the Planning and Estimating and the Requirments. Specifically in the requirments, I wrote the introduction, project overview, and the development and target environments (865 words). 
<p></p>
Additionally, I have created this team website. This website is built off of the GitHub Pages platform, which allows me to host html pages via our GitHub respository. This allows our team to quickly and easily impliment changes to our site, using the same tool we use to work on our actual project. (216 words)
<p></p>
<h2>DevNote 9/30</h2>
<p></p>
Kyle Nelson, Austin Williams and I met on Friday (September 28th) to work on the Architecture assignment. I completed the Testing portion of the assignment (637 words), and began work on editing the website. 
<p></p>
During our digitial group meeting on the afternoon of September 30th, I made edits to the Testing portion of the Architecture Assignment, took an example photo of playing cards on a table for the use of the User Interface draft, and made the edits to the project website. Edits I made to the website include adding the pages for the Scedule, the Requirments (which used parts of the Project Plan assignment, and adding the contact information to the home page (122 words). Additionally, I contributed to making our Powerpoint for our presentation, making the Project Overview, Tools Used, and Architecture slides (81 words.) During this meeting we also discussed how we will go about creating our Hand Finding algorithm.
<p></p>

<h2>DevNote 10/12</h2>
<p></p>
Kyle Nelson, Austin Williams and I met a few times, both in person and in a digital conference call, to work on the content, practice, and present our presentation of our project so far. The presentation went well, and I feel we presented the project well.
<p></p>
Additionally, Kyle Nelson and I meet on Wednesday (October 12th) to work on the code of the actual project. I provided the cards for Kyle to use for him gathering the image dataset of cards. I began creating a "hello world" sort of program so that we have a solid foundation to work on. While working on getting the AR Core implimented, a software bugged when trying to push the.apk file to my Android phone for testing caused several crashes in Windows. This part of the project is being picked up by Austin, and I will be working on implimenting the ML Kit for image labeling from this point on. This software will be plugging into
<p></p>

<h2>DevNote 10/30</h2>
<p></p>
Kyle Nelson, Austin Williams and I met once in person on October 17th. At that meeting we gave an update on what each of us was doing for the project, and what we were planning on working in the near future.
<p></p>
For my part, I have being going through Google's Firebase GitHub repository and other sources of open source machine learning code. I have collected several pages of Java code I believe will help us succeed. 

<h2>DevNote 11/11</h2>
<p></p>
Kyle Nelson, Austin Williams, and I met on November 9th to work on the coding assignment. Since the testing device and the Android application emulator did not work for Austin, I presumed the role of tester. I would take the application as it was, build it on my setup, upload it as an .apk application to my phone, and test all the expected functionality of the app. When I would run into an error or issue, I would document this error and send it back to Austin for further refinement.
<p></p>
Additionally, I began work and typed up a large portion of the actual coding assignment document for submission. I partially filled out the implementation, testing, and metrics portions, in particular writing the User's manual and the Administratorâ€™s Manual. I had also made a basic outline for the presentation PowerPoint.
<p></p>
On November 11th, Kyle Nelson, (in a limited capacity, Austin Williams), and I meet for a digital meeting to finish up the coding assignment and the Coding Presentation PowerPoint.

<h2>DevNote 12/2</h2>
<p></p>
Kyle Nelson, Austin Williams and I met on Wednesday the 28th to discuss where we stood on the project. I worked on getting the ML Kit portion of the application up and running with the custom image model. I had been running into issues with the version of Android, as my phone, being a Google Pixel, updates to the very latest Android version, which can create compatability errors with the application. During this meeting, I had fixed this issue.
<p></p>
I have tried all weekend to get the ML Kit portion working. Getting the custom model has been a real challenge. All resources seemed to point me to creating a TensorFlow model on my system using a Python script on my computer. I've been attemping this, but it has difficult. Many of the resources are built for Unix/Linux and not for Windows. I found another resource called TensorFlow Lite that seemed to be less complex, but there is less documentation on this and I have not gotten that to work. Due to the time contraints, we have decided to go with a 'Plan B' that would produced a minimal viable product.
