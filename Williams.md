<h1> Williams </h1>

16SEP2018 - Today I wrote the System Model, User Interaction, and Functional Requirements for the Requirements Specification (totaling 603 words) and also designed the team logo.

30SEP2018 - Today I created the class diagram and wrote it's description for the architecture assignment.  In addition to that description I wrote the problems discovered for that section of the code review.  These two components of the architecture assignment contained 535 words total.  This brings my running word count up to 1138 words.

07OCT2018 - Today I began implementation of a test app to get the ARCore portion of our app up and running. I was able to get the test app to be openable and present a system message "Hello, World!"

10OCT2018 - I started adding the ARCore components into our test app, I was able to get the camera view to come up and start updating real time, I have been attempting to get the ARCore demo app where you tap on a surface and an object (the android mascot) appears on it.

12OCT2018 - I am still attempting to implement the ARCore demo within our test app.  I haven't yet been able to get it up and running on my emulator.  My emulator is having trouble with Google Play, I am having difficulties getting it to sign in to the Google Play Store to download the ARCore app.

17OCT2018 - I was able to get the ARCore demo up and running on my android emulator on my laptop.  It will be a lot more helpful to have a test device.  I will also email Dr. Haye's in regards to her android tablet that she said I could borrow.  Now I just need to figure out how to rip a still frame from the AR environment in preparation for labeling with the MLKit component.
