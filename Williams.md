<h1> Williams </h1>

16SEP2018 - Today I wrote the System Model, User Interaction, and Functional Requirements for the Requirements Specification (totaling 603 words) and also designed the team logo.

30SEP2018 - Today I created the class diagram and wrote it's description for the architecture assignment.  In addition to that description I wrote the problems discovered for that section of the code review.  These two components of the architecture assignment contained 535 words total.  This brings my running word count up to 1138 words.
